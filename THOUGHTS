All locations are stored in the Klein projection, in world-space

For now, all you can do is move around horizontally, on the z=0 plane.

How fast do you move?  I need to use the hyperbolic metric.

How do you render?  First move the user to the origin (change to world space), then render Euclideanly
   - This transformation will involve a fairly funky shader, but most of it can be deferred
     - Note that normals do NOT work in a Euclidean manner!
     - Texture coordinates are non-linear
